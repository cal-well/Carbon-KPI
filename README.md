# Carbon-KPI
Visualising the climate performance of Local Government

Our net-zero action plan details 153 climate initiatives to deliver net-zero across the organisation and borough by 2030, with progress measured by a suite of diverse Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This data-led approach is applied to individual projects but is not deployed on a broader level to integrate work across service areas.

Presentation of targets in this format limits their use in prioritising projects and galvanising support from officers, Councillors, residents or local organisations. Visualisations that help stakeholders to envision the benefits of a net-zero future would help unlock this barrier. 

The accelerator program will assist with graphics and geospatial visualisation of the effects of the KPIs on the local area. An extension of this will forecast future scenarios to show the impact of organisation actions. These tools would monitor performance and outliers in NTC's net-zero transition pathways, informing project reviews, budget-setting and new project development.
